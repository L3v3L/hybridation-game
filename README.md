# Hybridation

Hybridation was started as a [GameOff 2018 submission](https://l3v3l.itch.io/hybridation).

It's a game where players have to stop the Hybridation virus from spreading and taking over the world.

The main gameplay takes place on a Bio plane, represented in a hexagonal grid, each hexagon tile represents a cell.

The game is played by selecting a cell that has not been consumed by the virus and playing it against any adjacent cells that are contaminated.

Once the whole Bio plane has been cured, the patient is cured.
